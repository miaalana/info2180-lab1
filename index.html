           <p>I am a third year computer science major with a minor in economics. I was born late November in Kingston, Jamaica. I have one sibling and a puppy. My hobbies include watching dramas and gaming. I attended Immaculate Conception High School. I am interested in web development because I am interested in becoming a web developer in the future and this course will serve as a good foundation to help achieving the goal.</p>
